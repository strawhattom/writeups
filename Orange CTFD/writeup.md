# Orange CTF - Break The Bank

## Scenario

After several months of tracking, Interpol has managed to locate and break into the security system of a bank used by a criminal organization. We are looking for the best students from your school for this new edition of our serious game "Capture the Flag": mission Break the Bank. 

.... Good luck!

## Before starting

- We have to connect with ssh to the remote server where all the files are available to solves challenges

- User, password and remote ip server are sent to the participants in an e-mail.

- All flag are like : `{CHALLENGE_NAMEXX:BASE64ENCODED}`

## Starter

### START01 - Oh my Host !!!

*10 points*

Get hosts on the remote machine

`cat /etc/hosts`

`FLAG : {STARTER01:d2hhdCBhIHVzZWZ1bGwgZmlsZQ==}`



### START02 - Very Nice Challenge

*10 points*



We look for hidden files `ls -a`, look inside `.ssh/` and we get the flag

```bash
ls .ssh
```



### START03 - Find me

*10 points*

The flag is the only city where it is not in Casa De Papel show

`FLAG : {STARTER03:Milano}`



## Banking

We wanted to get a graphical interface of the website instead of a CLI one, we needed to tunnel the ssh connection to a port without a specific endpoint (`port 9050` in our case) :

1. We connect from remote and open a port `ssh -D 9050 kali@[ip]` where `ip` is told to us with the CTF email

2. Using the `nestat -tn` we access to all hosted servers and their port

3. The bank website is hosted at `10.0.0.14:80`

4. Add a proxy to our browsers in `SOCKS Host` section : `127.0.0.1` and port `9050`.

5. Now if we go to `10.0.0.14:80`, we can navigate through the bank website.



Most of the challenges were resolved by using the endpoint `10.0.0.14:80/robots.txt`

### BANK01 - what a style!

*50 points*



The name of the challenge is surely linked with the style (`css`) of the webpage, we searched on each `css` files.

Then we finally have interesting thing in `main.css`, a property containing `RkxBR3tCQU5LSU5HMTpjbVZoWkhSb1pXTWtKQT09fQ==` which is the flag encoded in base64

Decoded message : `FLAG :{BANKING1:cmVhZHRoZWMkJA==}`

`cmVhZHRoZWMkJA==` decoded in base64 : `readthec$$`

### BANK02 - Hodor's account

*100 points*



A sql file is available at the endpoint /sql/data.sql, we have a sql script with password encrypted for Hodor.

His password seems to be not encrypted (`'HODOR!? Hodor? HODOR? hodor. hodor? rHoO â”‚ odoOorHODOR Hodor Hodor... oHodor. Hodor? HODOR? hodor!'`) but it is. We decrypted it with Hodor's algorithm.
It gives us `winterIsComing` which is his password, his username is `hhodor` When logging in, if we go down to the transaction page, we got the flag : 

`FLAG: {BANKING2:aG9kb3Job2RvcmhvZG9yNTE=}`

`aG9kb3Job2RvcmhvZG9yNTE=` decoded in base64 : `hodorhodorhodor51`

### BANK03 - It's christmas ! (partially resolved)

*200 points*



Using the endpoint `/secret/secrets.txt`

We find the following text : 
`// AES/ECB-EDE/NO-Padding
I1Arxhucf7RooXyRNrgtzUfm/LcaG4vxWRktZhuxbyqsuziMuCuamDASms3u1vsT`
This message is encoded with AES' algorithm and we have to decipher it in 3 step, decode / encode / decode.

### BANK04 - Common business oriented language

*100 points*

From the website we can obtain a file from `/robots.txt` which is `intellectual-property.cbl` a cobol script.

We use an online compiler to execute the code : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cobol_online.php but there is a syntax error on line 2, we need to add a `.` (dot) at the end of the line after 'CTF'.
we get : 

```
>FlaG:                                               <
>RkxBR3tCQU5LSU5HNDpRekJDTUV4cEpFRjNaWE52YldVaElRPT19<
```

Decoded in base64 :
`FLAG : {BANKING4:QzBCMExpJEF3ZXNvbWUhIQ==}` 

where `QzBCMExpJEF3ZXNvbWUhIQ==` decoded in base64 is `C0B0Li$Awesome!!`

### BANK05 - Google Is My Friend

*50 points*



Getting on the website, we look around the source code.

At the bottom of it we get this comment :

```html
<!-- We could have added https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=CT%46%20%46%4CAG%7BB%41NK%49NG5%3AZmVsaXogbmF2aWRhZA%3D%3D%7D in order to be more social -->

We go on the link and it shows the flag

`FLAG : {BANKING5:ZmVsaXogbmF2aWRhZA==}` 

 `ZmVsaXogbmF2aWRhZA==` decoded in base64 : `feliz navidad` which means "merry christmas" in spanish.
